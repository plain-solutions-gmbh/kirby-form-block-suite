## Microman License allows you to:

Use the digital work ("Item") under an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license.

Create one to Unlimited End Products, depending on your package tier, for yourself or your clients. Modify or manipulate the Item, combine it with other works, and create derivative works.

Use the Item in one to Unlimited End Products, depending on your package tier, and in one to Unlimited End projects, depending on your package tier.

## You cannot:

Re-distribute the Item as a stock image or its source files, even with modifications. In other words, you cannot replicate or modify the item and sell it as a theme/product on any marketplace as your own.

## Other license terms:

Some components of the Item may have different license terms from elsewhere, such as someone else's license or an open source or creative commons license. If this is the case, the component will be identified in the Item's description page or in the Item's downloaded files. The other license will apply to that component, and this license will apply to the rest of the Item. You can find all these components on the credits page (microman credits).

## Security & Payments

We process all payments securely through Paddle (PayPal or Stripe). We do not process payments directly through our website.

## Returns and Refunds Policy

We do not provide refunds for digital products. If you have any issues receiving or downloading our products, please contact us for assistance.
